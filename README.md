# OurWedding2023

On October 9th, 2022, eight hours after finishing the Chicago Marathon, I made the greatest decision of my life and asked my partner Madelyn to marry me.

About a month later I made the worst decision of my life and volunteered to make our wedding website, not having made one before. Nevertheless, we'll do the best we can.

In here you'll find a functional wedding website, covering the main functions one would desire. Going through the changelog, you'll find simple commits by me and much more professionally authored changes by Madelyn. There might be some flirting in there, fair warning.

## Function

This website will guide guests through the important details for attending a wedding. These will include the following pages:

* A Home page welcoming guests
* An RSVP page where guests confirm their attendance and other details
* A Story page sharing the details of the wedding party
    - Bride and Groom
    - Best Man and Groomsmen
    - Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids
* A Logistics page detailing the locations and travel
   - Arriving to the city, getting around, and what to do
   - The ceremony venue
   - The reception venue
* A Registry page, redirecting to the couple's gift registry
* A Game page, featuring a simple personalized javascript ball game

## Standards

Whenever possible, the site will conform to best practices according to the W3C and be accessible across browsers.
