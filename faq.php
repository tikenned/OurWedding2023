            <br />
            <p>We are asking our guests to wear cocktail attire. Cocktail attire is higher in formality than business casual or semi-formal, but lower than black-tie or formal.</p>
            <p>Confused? Sometimes I am too, even though it's one of the most popular dress codes for weddings. If you're not sure what to wear, click below for advice and some examples:</p>

            <br />
            <p>Driving into Chicago, finding parking, daily parking costs, and navigating traffic...<br>we've felt all these headaches so you don't have to.</p>
            <p>On our logistics page, we've done our best to give a range of options for your arrival to not have to drive into the city. 
                Whether near or far, we have navigated through every major airport and train station, and we're passing our expert knowledge to you.</p>
            <p>After you arrive, the city's public transit and rideshares can get you wherever you need to go without too long a delay or cost - definitely less than the price tag on getting a car around!</p>
            <p>We've also worked hard to keep all our main locales within ten to fifteen minutes walking distance, not only for your convenience but for you to enjoy our neighborhood the same as we do.</p>
            <p>For our guests requiring mobility assistance, we're keeping track of your requests in your RSVP and will accomodate your needs as best as we can.</p>

                    <h3>Madelyn</h3>
		    <h5 class="teal-text text-darken-4 bridal-party-role">Bride</h5>
		    <p>
			Madelyn is a Notre Dame-loving, plant-growing, lemon-rice-soup-cooking young woman, and she is absolutely delighted to be marrying Tim! She works remotely as a backend software engineer, but definitely doesn't identify as a "tech-bro" or "gamer". Her favorite activities include biking around the city with Tim, maintaining a small city vegetable garden, and trying new foods (as long as they're not too spicy). She has two adorable cats, Obie and Kareem, and has successfully taught them a few tricks!

                    <h3>Timothy</h3>
		    <h5 class="teal-text text-darken-4 bridal-party-role">Groom</h5>
		    <p>
                   Tim is a proud graduate of the university whose colors are Maize and Blue and, more importantly, is leading its rivalry against Notre Dame with a 25–17–1 record. He works remotely as a Product Manager for a West Coast startup; if you’re surprised he doesn’t have ‘Engineer’ in his title anymore then join the club. He volunteers at St Alphonsus as a leader for praise worship in the Young Adult Ministry’s Spiritual team and as a catechist for 7th graders, in addition to serving as an elected member of the Local School Council for Lincoln Park High School. His favorite activities include biking around the neighborhood and going on city adventures via the CTA, running along the lakefront with pit stops at the grocery store, thrifting for the next seasonal outfit, and doing his darndest not to kill the plants gifted to him by Madelyn. He has no cats, but is open to learning new tricks himself.
