            <h4 class="grey-text text-darken-3">What should I wear?</h4>
            <br />
            <p>We are asking our guests to wear <b>cocktail attire</b>. Cocktail attire is higher in formality than business casual or semi-formal, but lower than black-tie or formal.</p>
            <p>Confused? Sometimes I am too, even though it's one of the most popular dress codes for weddings. If you're not sure what to wear, click below for advice and some examples:</p>

            <h4 class="grey-text text-darken-3">What shoes should I wear?</h4>
            <br />
	    <p>Most of our guests will walk (or take the CTA bus) between our ceremony and reception (1/2 mile). So we recommend that you wear (or bring) shoes that are comfortable for walking.</p>

            <h4 class="grey-text text-darken-3">Do I need to drive in the city?</h4>
            <br />
	    <p>No you do not! In fact, we strongly recommend NOT driving in the city. Driving in the city is tricky, time-consuming, slow, and really expensive.</p> 
	    <p>After you arrive in the city, we recommend riding the CTA, walking, and/or biking between locations. All are faster, cheaper, less stressful, and more fun than driving! For your convenience, we've intentionally chosen our main event locales to all be within fifteen minutes walking distance of each other. We hope you enjoy our neighborhood as much as we do!</p> 
	    <!--
            <p>On our logistics page, we've done our best to give a range of options for your arrival to not have to drive into the city. 
                Whether near or far, we have navigated through every major airport and train station, and we're passing our expert local knowledge to you.</p>
            <p>For our guests requiring mobility assistance, we're keeping track of your requests in your RSVP and will accomodate your needs as best as we can.</p>

                    <h3>Madelyn</h3>
		    <h5 class="teal-text text-darken-4 bridal-party-role">Bride</h5>
		    <p>
			Madelyn is a Notre Dame-loving, plant-growing, lemon-rice-soup-cooking young woman, and she is absolutely delighted to be marrying Tim! She works remotely as a backend software engineer, but definitely doesn't identify as a "tech-bro" or "gamer". Her favorite activities include biking around the city with Tim, maintaining a small city vegetable garden, and trying new foods (as long as they're not too spicy). She has two adorable cats, Obie and Kareem, and has successfully taught them a few tricks!

                    <h3>Timothy</h3>
		    <h5 class="teal-text text-darken-4 bridal-party-role">Groom</h5>
		    <p>
                   Tim is a proud graduate of the university whose colors are Maize and Blue and, more importantly, is leading its rivalry against Notre Dame with a 25–17–1 record. He works remotely as a Product Manager for a West Coast startup; if you’re surprised he doesn’t have ‘Engineer’ in his title anymore then join the club. He volunteers at St Alphonsus as a leader for praise worship in the Young Adult Ministry’s Spiritual team and as a catechist for 7th graders, in addition to serving as an elected member of the Local School Council for Lincoln Park High School. His favorite activities include biking around the neighborhood and going on city adventures via the CTA, running along the lakefront with pit stops at the grocery store, thrifting for the next seasonal outfit, and doing his darndest not to kill the plants gifted to him by Madelyn. He has no cats, but is open to learning new tricks himself.
