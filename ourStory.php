    <h3 class="grey-text text-darken-3">Tim's Side</h3>

	  <p>After graduating from the Greatest University in the World (Go Blue) with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I moved far from home to seek my fortune on the eastern seaboard. Coming up a little wiser but strapped for cash after 2 years in Boston, I thought of relocating. Somewhere over a rainbow where rent wouldn’t put him on the street. Or, maybe to a city closer to home where family and Midwestern Big Ten energy was in large supply and the transit system wasn’t stuck in the late 19th century. Or most likely of all, aside from all the logical reasons, there was an inexorable and divine pull toward Chicago from the Man Upstairs (that’s God, for the non-Catholics).</p>

    <p>Within 3 months of settling into my new life, I went on a Hinge date with a very pretty redhead. She talked a lot, had an opinion about everything, and was late because she ubered from a mile away. She also possessed great passion, was full of knowledge, and I chose to ask her keep walking together and run a couple errands after the 'official date' had ended. It was as comfortable going with her as though I had known her for years.</p>
    
    <p>Two dates later she was ready to be exclusive. I figured it was worth a try - I hadn’t been nailed down for a while, let's see how this goes.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, there was an opportunity not long after for me to travel to Europe for work, coinciding with some already planned time off before jetting home. So, with about 5 weeks under the relationship belt, I invited the spunky gal to go with me. I figured that since things were going so well, it was worth it to put the relationship to the test. If it went well, all the better; if it bombed, I had been in worse before. Everyone I told, friends and family, were all (rightfully) mildly to moderately concerned at how easily the decision was made.</p>

    <p>As I weaved this story, I finished each section with a decision I made. To the outside world, and especially to those who know me well, many decisions take time and thought to process completely and fully. While I applied some time and thought in all these decisions, there was no usual agonizing or second guessing. There was only pure peace. Even in our ups and downs since then, peace reigns supreme in my heart.</p>
    
    <p>I love Madelyn with every fibre of myself, more than I ever thought I could and enough to scare me. She resonates my soul with her spirituality, pushes me forward with her courageousness and ambition, and shares with me so many of the joyful things that I have in my life, from running to car-free city living to playing music at church together. </p>

    <p>I am so blessed to have her as my partner, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives together.</p>
