    <h3 class="grey-text text-darken-3">Tim's Side</h3>

	  <p>After graduating from the Greatest University in the World (Go Blue) with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I moved far from home to seek my fortune on the eastern seaboard. Coming up a little wiser but strapped for cash after 2 years in Boston, I thought of relocating. Somewhere over a rainbow where rent wouldn’t put him on the street. Or, maybe to a city closer to home where family and Midwestern Big Ten energy was in large supply and the transit system wasn’t stuck in the late 19th century. Or most likely of all, aside from all the logical reasons, there was an inexorable and divine pull toward Chicago from the Man Upstairs (that’s God, for the non-Catholics).</p>

    <p>Within 3 months of settling into my new life, I went on a Hinge date with a very pretty redhead. She talked a lot, had an opinion about everything, and was late because she ubered from a mile away. She also possessed great passion, was full of knowledge, and I chose to ask her keep walking together and run a couple errands after the 'official date' had ended. It was as comfortable going with her as though I had known her for years.</p>
    
    <p>Two dates later she was ready to be exclusive. I figured it was worth a try - I hadn’t been nailed down for a while, let's see how this goes.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, there was an opportunity not long after for me to travel to Europe for work, coinciding with some already planned time off before jetting home. So, with about 5 weeks under the relationship belt, I invited the spunky gal to go with me. I figured that since things were going so well, it was worth it to put the relationship to the test. If it went well, all the better; if it bombed, I had been in worse before. Everyone I told, friends and family, were all (rightfully) mildly to moderately concerned at how easily the decision was made.</p>

    <p>As I weaved this story, I finished each section with a decision I made. To the outside world, and especially to those who know me well, many decisions take time and thought to process completely and fully. While I applied some time and thought in all these decisions, there was no usual agonizing or second guessing. There was only pure peace. Even in our ups and downs since then, peace reigns supreme in my heart.</p>
    
    <p>I love Madelyn with every fibre of myself, more than I ever thought I could and enough to scare me. She resonates my soul with her spirituality, pushes me forward with her courageousness and ambition, and shares with me so many of the joyful things that I have in my life, from running to car-free city living to playing music at church together. </p>

    <p>I am so blessed to have her as my partner, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives together.</p>

After many years searching for the right person in Chicago (and what felt like hundreds of first dates via different apps and groups), a brand new name popped up on my Hinge app - “Timothy K”. And his profile was extremely impressive - a man who was Catholic, AND progressive, AND my age, AND a runner, AND musically talented, AND has a job in STEM? As you might guess, I was very surprised that he wasn’t already taken, and did not hesitate to swipe right and give it a shot.
</p>
<p>
On our first date at a local coffee shop (see the wedding map if you want to go there yourself), I intentionally offered to pay in order to test how comfortable he was around a strong, confident, financially independent woman… and what do you know? He passed the test! I paid for our lattes, his masculinity was not harmed, and from that point on it was smooth sailing.
</p>
<p>
By the end of our second date, I knew he was the one. Our relationship was easy and natural. It felt “right”, and different than any other past relationship. Just to be safe though, I didn’t tell him that I knew he was the one until a few months later - I didn’t want to come off too strong too early!
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a couple months, and both of our respective friend groups were understandably concerned about our trip to Europe so early into our relationship - but by that point, we both knew that this was going to last. I figured that in the absolute worst case, a trip to Europe by myself wouldn’t be so bad. And after all, how often does a fully-paid-by-work trip to Europe come along in life? 
</p>
<p>
Tim is the one. I am so thrilled to marry him! Counting down the days until I become Mrs. Kennedy!
